Requirements
C# Tasks

    Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
    All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
    You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
    All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
    All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

C# Tests

    Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
    All tests should be inside a separate folder
    All your test files will be executed using dotnet test
    We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge cases

For this project:

    Based on the requirements of each task, you should write the documentation and tests first before you actually code anything
    The intranet checks for C# projects won’t be released before their first deadline in order for you to focus more on TDD and thinking about all possible cases
    We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge cases
    Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
